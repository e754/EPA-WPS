10,EPA-HQ-OPP-2024-0562-0473,"Posted by the Environmental Protection Agency on Feb 18, 2025","I ask you to deny the petition submitted by the attorneys general (AGs), which misrepresents the authority and responsibility of state governments in protecting public health and safety.

While the petition targets California's Proposition 65 warnings on glyphosate products, its implications extend far beyond this issue and threaten to undermine states' ability to regulate pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). In 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) informed California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) that its glyphosate labeling violated FIFRA. However, OEHHA clarified that Proposition 65 is a right-to-know law designed to provide clear warnings to the public about chemicals listed as carcinogens or reproductive toxins, including glyphosate. These warnings empower Californians to make informed decisions about their exposure to hazardous chemicals.

Proposition 65 mandates the listing of chemicals, at a minimum, based on classifications from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). In 2015, IARC classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen, prompting California to list it under Proposition 65. As a result, businesses are required to provide warnings when their products containing glyphosate expose individuals to potentially harmful levels of the chemical unless those levels are below the specified threshold.

In 2022, the EPA affirmed that California could include IARC's classification in its warning labels. While California offers flexibility in how these warnings are communicated, pesticide labels have historically been the method for conveying such critical information. Court decisions have underscored the importance of these warnings in holding manufacturers accountable for failing to inform consumers of potential risks. The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Bates v. Dow Agrosciences (2005) reaffirmed the legal duty of manufacturers to warn consumers about the risks associated with their products, including pesticides.

FIFRA allows states to regulate the sale or use of federally registered pesticides, but only if the regulation does not conflict with federal law or permit the sale or use of products prohibited by it. However, the AGs' petition seeks to prevent states from requiring hazard warnings on pesticide labels, putting consumers at greater risk of harm.

States and local governments have a long history of implementing protective measures to safeguard their residents, land, and water. This right to protect public health has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. The petition by the AGs, however, seems to disregard the welfare of their residents by prioritizing uniformity over safety. It implies that if people, including farmers, suffer harm from pesticides due to a failure to warn, they should not be able to seek compensation, even if the warning is legally required.

The courts have consistently upheld the responsibility of both states and manufacturers to warn consumers of the hazards posed by pesticides. This duty is in no way inconsistent with federal pesticide laws, including those governing ""misbranding.""

These pesticide manufacturers want to limit states and localities from passing and enforcing additional requirements for warnings and information related from pesticides, bending the rules so that people sickened by exposure to these chemicals can’t seek any remedies.

Pending House and Senate bills would achieve the companies’ goal. The bills include the Agricultural Labeling Uniformity Act, or H.R. 4288, and the EATS Act, or H.R. 4417/S. 2019. Proponents may try to attach the bills to the farm bill or other major legislation.

I strongly disagree with the current stance on weakening pesticide restrictions and urge the agency to take decisive action to ban glyphosate nationwide for the health and safety of all Americans. Glyphosate has been linked to severe health risks, including cancer, endocrine disruption, and harm to vital ecosystems. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen, and numerous studies have raised serious concerns about its long-term impact on human health and biodiversity.

While some may argue that glyphosate is essential for agricultural productivity, the trade-offs are far too great. Safer, sustainable alternatives exist, and many countries have already taken steps to limit or ban glyphosate due to the overwhelming scientific evidence of its dangers. The EPA must prioritize public health over corporate interests and implement a complete ban on glyphosate to protect our communities, food supply, and environment.

I urge the agency to follow the precautionary principle and act immediately to eliminate glyphosate from use in the United States. A failure to do so puts millions of Americans at risk.

By requiring all pesticide labeling to be consistent with the EPA’s findings of pesticides, the additional health warnings imposed by individual states would be overridden, reducing public protection.

All pesticides sold or distributed in the United States must be registered with the EPA. The Federal Pesticide Laws and Associated Statutes say the requirements for registration require proof that when used the pesticide, “will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.” This includes both unreasonable risks to human health and the environment, as well as human dietary risk from pesticide residues. Although the EPA sets national pesticide regulation, state pesticide offices work closely with the EPA and other federal agencies to enforce pesticide laws.

According to The National Pesticide Information Center, state governments play a large role in regulating pesticides past what the EPA’s federal pesticide regulations are. States must follow EPA regulations, so if their labeling does not identically match the EPA’s standards, it is because the states standards exceed the federal level warnings. This allows for more transparency about the health implications pesticides may have on the public. By enforcing a consistent label requirement across states, this proposed rule would likely reduce transparency and weaken public awareness of pesticide risks. I urge the EPA to reconsider this rule to prevent a nationwide rollback of critical health and safety protections.

Were EPA to adopt such a regulation, it would make a pesticide misbranded and illegal to sell or distribute if the label had a warning about cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm, unless EPA also determined that the active ingredient carried these risks in its human health risk assessment. What this would mean is the registration of the active ingredient could immunize manufacturers from state law misbranding actions over a failure to warn about these health risks.

The proposed rule conflicts with FIFRA. Under no circumstances can the registration of one ingredient provide a blanket defense to a misbranding action pursuant to Section 136a(f)(2). Moreover, the proposed rule conflicts FIFRA's prohibition against pesticides with labeling that ""does not contain directions for use which are necessary for effecting the purpose for which the product is intended and if complied with, together with any requirements imposed under section 136a(d) of this title, are adequate to protect health and the environment."" 7 USC 136(q)(f). This is because the proposed rule focuses solely on the active ingredient without consideration of the adverse effects posed by inactive ingredients, impurities, or the entirety of the chemical composition. As EPA itself has recognized in the past, these other components can be toxicologically significant. As such, without consideration as to the pesticide's other ingredients or impurities or the pesticide as a whole, EPA does not have a rational basis for preemptively determining that warnings about cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm are unnecessary based solely on its human health risk assessment as to the active ingredient.

EPA does not have the authority to override Congress and the provisions set forth under FIFRA. As such, it does not have the power to enact the proposed rule."

While the petition targets California Prop 65 warnings on glyphosate products, it goes much further in restricting the authority of states to restrict pesticides under FIFRA. In 2019, EPA told California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) that its label language for glyphosate violated the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Subsequently, OEHHA explained to EPA:

Proposition 65 is a right-to-know law that requires businesses to provide a clear and reasonable warning prior to exposing people in California to chemicals that have been listed as carcinogens or reproductive toxins. The warnings provide an important public health benefit by allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their exposures to listed chemicals.

Proposition 65 mandates the listing of at least the chemicals that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies as carcinogens. In 2015, IARC classified glyphosate as a carcinogen, prompting California to include it in Proposition 65. Consequently, Proposition 65 requires businesses to provide warnings if their products containing glyphosate would result in exposures, unless those exposures are below a certain threshold.

California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) inquired with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about the legality of citing IARC’s classification in Proposition 65. In 2022, EPA affirmed that with such specificity, it would be permitted. While California offers various options for communicating Proposition 65 warnings, historically, the label has primarily conveyed warnings about pesticides.

In jury verdicts awarding damages to individuals suffering from cancer due to glyphosate exposure, courts have emphasized the failure to warn users of the hazards associated with the chemical. A Pesticides and You article (2005) by H. Bishop Dansby provides an explanation of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Bates v. Dow Agrosciences (U.S. Supreme Court, No. 03-388, 2005): “Manufacturers have a legal obligation to provide adequate warnings about the potential risks associated with their products, including pesticides. This duty arises from the recognition that manufacturers possess knowledge about the potential dangers of their products and have a responsibility to inform consumers about these risks.”

Regarding pesticide regulation, FIFRA explicitly states that a state may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device within its borders, provided that such regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this Act. Furthermore, FIFRA requires uniformity of labeling. The AG petition, however, focuses solely on the uniformity of labels and seeks to prohibit states from requiring product labels to warn users of potential hazards. This approach would subject users to increased risks of illness and neglect the fundamental principle of protecting people, land, and water from hazards.

States and local governments often employ creative measures to safeguard their residents, the environment, and public health from potential dangers. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right of states to protect their citizens from poisoning and contamination, recognizing the importance of safeguarding public well-being. The petition’s conclusion is clear: the AGs appear indifferent to the harm caused to farmers and other individuals in their states by pesticides, and they should not be able to seek compensation for adverse effects resulting from inadequate labeling.

The courts have consistently recognized the state’s and manufacturer’s “duty to warn” of pesticide hazards as a fundamental right and responsibility that does not conflict with federal pesticide law’s “misbranding” regulations. Therefore, we must uph

To allow industries (whose vested interest is to make monetary profits while deliberately risking the lives of American citizens by continuing to expose them to known poisonous chemicals) to prevail in suppressing protective measures for those citizens by state governments more concerned for their welfare than, apparently, is the federal government, is not only unconscionable, but criminal.

If this administration believes in returning power to the states, this should be no problem for the EPA. Let the people affected decide what chemicals are used where they live.

The current labeling system can sometimes be confusing or misleading, potentially leading to misuse of pesticides, harm to nontarget species, and environmental contamination.

By improving labeling regulations, the EPA can enhance transparency and ensure that users, including farmers, gardeners, and pest control professionals, have the necessary information to apply pesticides responsibly. Ipdated labels could also include clearer instructions on safe disposal and environmental precautions, which would help reduce pollution and protect biodiversity.

However, I encourage the EPA to collaborate closely with scientific experts and environmental groups to strike a balance between regulatory clarity and industry feasibility. Implementing changes that are practical and scientifically backed will ensure compliance and maximize positive outcomes.

326,EPA-HQ-OPP-2024-0562-0268,"Posted by the Environmental Protection Agency on Feb 12, 2025","Dear EPA Officials,
I am writing to express my deep concern regarding efforts to grant agrochemical companies immunity from liability for the harms caused by their products. Such policies would have devastating consequences for public health, environmental integrity, and the rights of farmers and consumers.
For decades, the agrochemical industry has assured the public that its pesticides, herbicides, and genetically modified seeds are safe. However, independent research continues to link these products to cancer, endocrine disruption, neurological disorders, and biodiversity loss. When corporations are shielded from accountability, those who suffer the most are farmers forced into dependency on toxic products, consumers exposed to harmful residues, and ecosystems devastated by chemical pollution.
History has repeatedly demonstrated the dangers of unchecked corporate influence in agriculture. DDT, Agent Orange, and glyphosate were once deemed safe—only for their toxic consequences to be revealed decades later. Granting these companies legal immunity would remove any incentive for them to ensure their products do not cause harm, allowing profits to take precedence over public safety.
I urge the EPA to uphold its duty to protect the environment and public health by opposing any policies that grant agrochemical corporations immunity from liability. Instead, regulatory measures should require independent, long-term safety testing and strict accountability for any harm caused by these products.
The EPA must prioritize the health of the people and the planet over corporate interests. I appreciate your attention to this critical issue and look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
Latisha Roe"

The EPA is considering a move that would block hundreds of state and local pesticide laws—leaving our schools, parks, playgrounds, and communities vulnerable to harmful chemicals like glyphosate. This decision puts corporate profits over public health and ignores critical scientific evidence about the dangers of these toxic substances.

State and local laws go further than the EPA’s outdated regulations, providing necessary safeguards for children, families, animals, and the environment. If these protections are stripped away, communities will be left with only the EPA’s weak and infrequent safety reviews—conducted just once every 15 years—despite overwhelming research linking pesticides to cancer and other life-threatening health conditions.

We cannot allow this reckless action to move forward. We demand that state and local governments retain the right to protect their citizens from toxic exposure.

Please do everything in your power to prevent this disastrous decision from being approved. I urge you to stand up for the health of American families and support stronger—not weaker—protections against toxic pesticides. Stop the corruption now!!! Please!

Americans should be protected from harmful pesticides. The average person does not pay attention to the caution statements on these pesticide products and sprays them indiscriminately where their children play and where wildlife has access to them. Neighbors may be affected by others in their neighborhood using these harmful chemicals (they affect more than just the person using the pesticide). Children may not exhibit the ill effects of these chemicals until later in life, causing debilitating illnesses. Wildlife may come in contact with these chemicals and die near the contaminated areas. This poses other problems and may create a spiral of death involving other animals. The chemicals can get into the ground water and affect neighboring wells. In essence, pesticide regulations must be kept at local and state levels to protect people and animals.

As a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, I am aware of the body of research and lawsuits that have lead to labeling of certain agrochemicals at the State level. The EPA has not followed the body of research or adjusted its standards in response to latest research to protect individuals.

I do not agree with this petition to override the States in labeling that have been proactive in protecting citizens when the EPA is not responsive to individual lawsuits or emerging research of the harms of the chemicals.

States must be able to pass laws and be responsive to their constituents especially when federal agencies have failed to do their job to protect individuals rather than corporations.

Federal regulators will soon decide whether to block hundreds of state and local pesticide laws – leaving schools, parks, playgrounds and communities vulnerable. This includes laws designed to protect children and notify parents when toxic pesticides like glyphosate will be sprayed.

Local laws – laws designed to protect people, animals, and the environment – go further than the EPA's regulations for pesticide use. If the EPA does block state and local laws, these places will have only the protection of the EPA's far less stringent standards.

One reason they're weaker is the EPA reviews the safety of pesticides only once every 15 years, so their standards may not reflect the latest science.

***Since the 1970's, chemical Pesticides have been used in the U.S. They have been proven to be cancer causing and responsible, in part, for many chronic diseases, besides GMO's, artificial dyes/colors & flavors, addicting flavor enhancers, fake lab meat, ultra-processed foods, seed & vegetable oils cut with cheaper oils, toxic farm-raised seafood, etc.***

It is no wonder why so many Americans, including innocent children, are so sick!

This needs to STOP NOW!! No more POISON in our environment or food supply!

Blocking state and local pesticide laws would prevent states from protecting their unique local environments and communities, including vulnerable people like children, from toxic pesticides.

It would also keep them from responding to emerging risks and cut off notification requirements to parents when toxic pesticides will be sprayed at school or near parks.

I urge you to take SERIOUS action to protect these important local laws.

Thank you,

Many other countries have banned pesticide chemicals like glyphosate because they have been linked to cancer, reproductive harm and other serious health risks, yet we in the U.S. continue to ignore this and willingly choose to harm our families' and friends' lives.

So, will try to submit my comment again. The EPA must make protection --- of the public, of our water sources, air, food supplies, of children, of pregnant women, of workers applying dangerous pesticides, and of the animals (like pollinators) a priority when labeling pesticides. True story: I was vacationing in the U.S. Virgin Islands a while back when a story broke about an entire family's health crisis. This family was also vacationing but, improper application of a harmful pesticide traveled through (apparently) the air conditioning units. The result was neural/nerve damage for them. Even the medical personnel who responded to their 911 calls when they got sick, were also affected by the pesticide just from being in the same room where they were treating and attending to the family members! Strict and clear labeling and regulations for all chemicals is necessary, and is important to the health of people, of first responders, of animals, and the viability of our water sources and food supplies. The EPA must protect the public, protect our food and water sources, protect all who come in contact with deadly pesticides and must clearly label what the particular pesticide does to all of the above, and must clearly say how one can safely dispose of it without poisoning local water supplies and food."

It would also eliminate our ability to keep chemicals away from Community Garden areas, choose our agriculture to be more organic and be aware of our special land conditions that exacerbate the movement of dangerous chemicals. Every Town Board in charge of Land Management has the knowledge of their unique environment and should be the folks specifically making any choices regarding herbicides and pesticides in public areas! And any private localities within a Town should have to work with the Town to ensure they are complying with the overall Town focus.

If you or others would prefer that hundreds of thousands or more Americans are sickened, injured or or eventually killed by pesticides in our air, water and food, then do nothing.
