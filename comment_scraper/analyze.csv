I urge you to reject any efforts that try to overturn state and local pesticide regulations. It is hard for me to understand just why the powers that be want the American public to be unhealthy by continuing consuming low to moderate doses of toxins.

I live in an area where there are lots of sports activities for children of most ages. There are also many very nice golf courses for club members as well as the public. Therefore, I am very concerned about our children regarding pesticides and herbicides.

Also, I am greatly concerned about the run-off from these items. We have lots of farms for cattle, sheep and vegetables. However, I have to be very careful what I buy as I have multiple autoimmune issues which are aggravated by chemicals in my food.

The only exception are where a specific power is enumerated in the Constitution, or the Statecs law is unconstitutional.
The power of the EPA to overule States rights is not enumerated in the Constitution.
And since State and local laws are subject to the same burdon of constitutionality, any standing State or local law that has not been chalenged and struck down in a court of law as unconstitutional, cannot be disregarded.
So the EPA has no right to overule State or local statutes regulating pesticide use. Even if the current federal government would prefer to prioritize the profits of multi-national corperations, the democratic rule of law does not allow them to disregard citizens right to self government.

Many of these pesticides are already banned in other countries due to their well-documented risks, including harm to pollinators, contamination of water sources, and links to serious human health conditions.

By overriding local and state protections, the EPA would be prioritizing the interests of chemical manufacturers over the well-being of communities. States and municipalities have the right to enact stricter safeguards based on the needs of their residents, local ecosystems, and agricultural industries.

Federal regulators will soon decide whether to block hundreds of state and local pesticide laws – leaving schools, parks, playgrounds and communities vulnerable. This includes laws designed to protect children and notify parents when toxic pesticides like glyphosate will be sprayed.

Local laws – laws designed to protect people, animals, and the environment – go further than the EPA's regulations for pesticide use. If the EPA does block state and local laws, these places will have only the protection of the EPA's far less stringent standards.

One reason they're weaker is the EPA reviews the safety of pesticides only once every 15 years, so their standards may not reflect the latest science. Despite clear scientific links between toxic pesticides like glyphosate to life-threatening health conditions like cancer, corporate profits are being prioritized over public safety",True,True,True,True

I don't want federal bureaucrats overriding decisions made at the state and local level to make their communities safe from toxic pesticides. The EPA should set minimum national standards, but state and local agencies should have the freedom to set stricter standards.

Blocking state and local pesticide laws would prevent states from protecting their unique local environments and communities, including vulnerable people like children, from toxic pesticides. It would also keep them from responding to emerging risks and cut off notification requirements to parents when toxic pesticides will be sprayed at school or near parks.

Please take serious action to protect these important local laws.

Individual states should not be able to undermine Federal safety standards and findings, but should only be able to put additional restrictions and cautions as deemed indicated by scientific factual findings. State input into Federal Agency rule making should be at the Federal level. Chaos and possible harm could ensue if states were allowed to undermine, rather than augment, Federal safety standards.",True,True,True,True
