10,10,EPA-HQ-OPP-2024-0562-0473,"Posted by the Environmental Protection Agency on Feb 18, 2025","I ask you to deny the petition submitted by the attorneys general (AGs), which misrepresents the authority and responsibility of state governments in protecting public health and safety.

While the petition targets California's Proposition 65 warnings on glyphosate products, its implications extend far beyond this issue and threaten to undermine states' ability to regulate pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). In 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) informed California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) that its glyphosate labeling violated FIFRA. However, OEHHA clarified that Proposition 65 is a right-to-know law designed to provide clear warnings to the public about chemicals listed as carcinogens or reproductive toxins, including glyphosate. These warnings empower Californians to make informed decisions about their exposure to hazardous chemicals.

Proposition 65 mandates the listing of chemicals, at a minimum, based on classifications from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). In 2015, IARC classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen, prompting California to list it under Proposition 65. As a result, businesses are required to provide warnings when their products containing glyphosate expose individuals to potentially harmful levels of the chemical unless those levels are below the specified threshold.

In 2022, the EPA affirmed that California could include IARC's classification in its warning labels. While California offers flexibility in how these warnings are communicated, pesticide labels have historically been the method for conveying such critical information. Court decisions have underscored the importance of these warnings in holding manufacturers accountable for failing to inform consumers of potential risks. The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Bates v. Dow Agrosciences (2005) reaffirmed the legal duty of manufacturers to warn consumers about the risks associated with their products, including pesticides.

FIFRA allows states to regulate the sale or use of federally registered pesticides, but only if the regulation does not conflict with federal law or permit the sale or use of products prohibited by it. However, the AGs' petition seeks to prevent states from requiring hazard warnings on pesticide labels, putting consumers at greater risk of harm.

States and local governments have a long history of implementing protective measures to safeguard their residents, land, and water. This right to protect public health has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. The petition by the AGs, however, seems to disregard the welfare of their residents by prioritizing uniformity over safety. It implies that if people, including farmers, suffer harm from pesticides due to a failure to warn, they should not be able to seek compensation, even if the warning is legally required.

The courts have consistently upheld the responsibility of both states and manufacturers to warn consumers of the hazards posed by pesticides. This duty is in no way inconsistent with federal pesticide laws, including those governing ""misbranding.""

I strongly disagree with the current stance on weakening pesticide restrictions and urge the agency to take decisive action to ban glyphosate nationwide for the health and safety of all Americans. Glyphosate has been linked to severe health risks, including cancer, endocrine disruption, and harm to vital ecosystems. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen, and numerous studies have raised serious concerns about its long-term impact on human health and biodiversity.

While some may argue that glyphosate is essential for agricultural productivity, the trade-offs are far too great. Safer, sustainable alternatives exist, and many countries have already taken steps to limit or ban glyphosate due to the overwhelming scientific evidence of its dangers. The EPA must prioritize public health over corporate interests and implement a complete ban on glyphosate to protect our communities, food supply, and environment.

I urge the agency to follow the precautionary principle and act immediately to eliminate glyphosate from use in the United States. A failure to do so puts millions of Americans at risk.

All pesticides sold or distributed in the United States must be registered with the EPA.

Although the EPA sets national pesticide regulation, state pesticide offices work closely with the EPA and other federal agencies to enforce pesticide laws.

According to The National Pesticide Information Center, state governments play a large role in regulating pesticides past what the EPA’s federal pesticide regulations are. States must follow EPA regulations, so if their labeling does not identically match the EPA’s standards, it is because the states standards exceed the federal level warnings. This allows for more transparency about the health implications pesticides may have on the public.

While the petition targets California Prop 65 warnings on glyphosate products, it goes much further in restricting the authority of states to restrict pesticides under FIFRA. In 2019, EPA told California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) that its label language for glyphosate violated the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Subsequently, OEHHA explained to EPA:

Proposition 65 is a right-to-know law that requires businesses to provide a clear and reasonable warning prior to exposing people in California to chemicals that have been listed as carcinogens or reproductive toxins. The warnings provide an important public health benefit by allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their exposures to listed chemicals.

Proposition 65 mandates the listing of at least the chemicals that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies as carcinogens. In 2015, IARC classified glyphosate as a carcinogen, prompting California to include it in Proposition 65. Consequently, Proposition 65 requires businesses to provide warnings if their products containing glyphosate would result in exposures, unless those exposures are below a certain threshold.

California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) inquired with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about the legality of citing IARC’s classification in Proposition 65. In 2022, EPA affirmed that with such specificity, it would be permitted. While California offers various options for communicating Proposition 65 warnings, historically, the label has primarily conveyed warnings about pesticides.

In jury verdicts awarding damages to individuals suffering from cancer due to glyphosate exposure, courts have emphasized the failure to warn users of the hazards associated with the chemical. A Pesticides and You article (2005) by H. Bishop Dansby provides an explanation of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Bates v. Dow Agrosciences (U.S. Supreme Court, No. 03-388, 2005): “Manufacturers have a legal obligation to provide adequate warnings about the potential risks associated with their products, including pesticides. This duty arises from the recognition that manufacturers possess knowledge about the potential dangers of their products and have a responsibility to inform consumers about these risks.”

Regarding pesticide regulation, FIFRA explicitly states that a state may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device within its borders, provided that such regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this Act. Furthermore, FIFRA requires uniformity of labeling. The AG petition, however, focuses solely on the uniformity of labels and seeks to prohibit states from requiring product labels to warn users of potential hazards. This approach would subject users to increased risks of illness and neglect the fundamental principle of protecting people, land, and water from hazards.

States and local governments often employ creative measures to safeguard their residents, the environment, and public health from potential dangers. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right of states to protect their citizens from poisoning and contamination, recognizing the importance of safeguarding public well-being. The petition’s conclusion is clear: the AGs appear indifferent to the harm caused to farmers and other individuals in their states by pesticides, and they should not be able to seek compensation for adverse effects resulting from inadequate labeling.

The courts have consistently recognized the state’s and manufacturer’s “duty to warn” of pesticide hazards as a fundamental right and responsibility that does not conflict with federal pesticide law’s “misbranding” regulations. Therefore, we must uph

Does the local wildlife and fish have way to be notified of toxic spraying in/near/downstream from their homes? Let us hope the toxin does not trickle down to clams and salmon we like to eat.

The current labeling system can sometimes be confusing or misleading, potentially leading to misuse of pesticides, harm to nontarget species, and environmental contamination.

By improving labeling regulations, the EPA can enhance transparency and ensure that users, including farmers, gardeners, and pest control professionals, have the necessary information to apply pesticides responsibly. Ipdated labels could also include clearer instructions on safe disposal and environmental precautions, which would help reduce pollution and protect biodiversity.

However, I encourage the EPA to collaborate closely with scientific experts and environmental groups to strike a balance between regulatory clarity and industry feasibility. Implementing changes that are practical and scientifically backed will ensure compliance and maximize positive outcomes.

The current labeling system can sometimes be confusing or misleading, potentially leading to misuse of pesticides, harm to nontarget species, and environmental contamination.

By improving labeling regulations, the EPA can enhance transparency and ensure that users, including farmers, gardeners, and pest control professionals, have the necessary information to apply pesticides responsibly. Ipdated labels could also include clearer instructions on safe disposal and environmental precautions, which would help reduce pollution and protect biodiversity.

However, I encourage the EPA to collaborate closely with scientific experts and environmental groups to strike a balance between regulatory clarity and industry feasibility. Implementing changes that are practical and scientifically backed will ensure compliance and maximize positive outcomes.

I urge you to take serious action to protect these important local laws. Yahweh created the earth, and it was perfect. We were to eat from the earth to get minerals and nutrients into our body. Now we have chemicals from food, water and air going into everything it lands on. When is it enough. That is why cancer is so widespread that is a fact. Humans were to be responsible for taking good care of the earth and it is a shame how that job was ignored by certain people who do not care about animal life or human life. The bible says Yahweh will destroy those who are destroying the earth. That was a warning from God. America is the biggest user of chemicals even in warfare as we know in the Vietnam War. Many children were born deformed from the use of Agent Orange and other chemicals in Vietnam. Ane the American soldiers had horrible skin diseases from being sprayed upon too. Americal should have learned a lesson back then. These people who are getting rich from these chemical companies are not going to get away from all the harm they did. There are people behind these companies who are making these decisions, and they will have to answer to the Almighty Creator at Judgement. There will be no explanation they will be able to give to God for destroying the earth and killing his creation. Let this be a warning before you decide to go ahead with your agendas. God gave you a warning. Read your bibles and repent. Yashua is coming soon! Take this seriously and don't hate the messenger for lovingly warning people.

We should not be moving backward, especially now that we know how harmful these chemicals are. We want our local (and federal) government to protect us and not be coerced by big chemical companies who stand to profit big time.

Blocking state and local pesticide laws would prevent states from protecting their unique local environments and communities, including vulnerable people like children, from toxic pesticides. It would also keep them from responding to emerging risks and cut off notification requirements to parents when toxic pesticides will be sprayed at school or near parks.

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding efforts to grant agrochemical companies immunity from liability for the harms caused by their products. Such policies would have devastating consequences for public health, environmental integrity, and the rights of farmers and consumers.
For decades, the agrochemical industry has assured the public that its pesticides, herbicides, and genetically modified seeds are safe. However, independent research continues to link these products to cancer, endocrine disruption, neurological disorders, and biodiversity loss. When corporations are shielded from accountability, those who suffer the most are farmers forced into dependency on toxic products, consumers exposed to harmful residues, and ecosystems devastated by chemical pollution.
History has repeatedly demonstrated the dangers of unchecked corporate influence in agriculture. DDT, Agent Orange, and glyphosate were once deemed safe—only for their toxic consequences to be revealed decades later. Granting these companies legal immunity would remove any incentive for them to ensure their products do not cause harm, allowing profits to take precedence over public safety.
I urge the EPA to uphold its duty to protect the environment and public health by opposing any policies that grant agrochemical corporations immunity from liability. Instead, regulatory measures should require independent, long-term safety testing and strict accountability for any harm caused by these products.
The EPA must prioritize the health of the people and the planet over corporate interests. I appreciate your attention to this critical issue and look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
Latisha Roe","Dear EPA Officials,

Americans should be protected from harmful pesticides. The average person does not pay attention to the caution statements on these pesticide products and sprays them indiscriminately where their children play and where wildlife has access to them. Neighbors may be affected by others in their neighborhood using these harmful chemicals (they affect more than just the person using the pesticide). Children may not exhibit the ill effects of these chemicals until later in life, causing debilitating illnesses. Wildlife may come in contact with these chemicals and die near the contaminated areas. This poses other problems and may create a spiral of death involving other animals. The chemicals can get into the ground water and affect neighboring wells. In essence, pesticide regulations must be kept at local and state levels to protect people and animals.

Children may not exhibit the ill effects of these chemicals until later in life, causing debilitating illnesses. Wildlife may come in contact with these chemicals and die near the contaminated areas. This poses other problems and may create a spiral of death involving other animals. The chemicals can get into the ground water and affect neighboring wells. In essence, pesticide regulations must be kept at local and state levels to protect people and animals.

Pesticide exposure can cause numerous health issues, especially in children, which include leukemia and other neurological issues. Protecting our human health should be a number one priority. This is a drastic overstep of the federal government to tell local legislators what they can and cannot do in their state and erodes local communities for making decisions that are best for their community members.
