While the petition targets California's Proposition 65 warnings on glyphosate products, its implications extend far beyond this issue and threaten to undermine states' ability to regulate pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). In 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) informed California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) that its glyphosate labeling violated FIFRA. However, OEHHA clarified that Proposition 65 is a right-to-know law designed to provide clear warnings to the public about chemicals listed as carcinogens or reproductive toxins, including glyphosate. These warnings empower Californians to make informed decisions about their exposure to hazardous chemicals.

Proposition 65 mandates the listing of chemicals, at a minimum, based on classifications from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). In 2015, IARC classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen, prompting California to list it under Proposition 65. As a result, businesses are required to provide warnings when their products containing glyphosate expose individuals to potentially harmful levels of the chemical unless those levels are below the specified threshold.

In 2022, the EPA affirmed that California could include IARC's classification in its warning labels. While California offers flexibility in how these warnings are communicated, pesticide labels have historically been the method for conveying such critical information. Court decisions have underscored the importance of these warnings in holding manufacturers accountable for failing to inform consumers of potential risks. The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Bates v. Dow Agrosciences (2005) reaffirmed the legal duty of manufacturers to warn consumers about the risks associated with their products, including pesticides.

FIFRA allows states to regulate the sale or use of federally registered pesticides, but only if the regulation does not conflict with federal law or permit the sale or use of products prohibited by it. However, the AGs' petition seeks to prevent states from requiring hazard warnings on pesticide labels, putting consumers at greater risk of harm.

States and local governments have a long history of implementing protective measures to safeguard their residents, land, and water. This right to protect public health has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. The petition by the AGs, however, seems to disregard the welfare of their residents by prioritizing uniformity over safety. It implies that if people, including farmers, suffer harm from pesticides due to a failure to warn, they should not be able to seek compensation, even if the warning is legally required.

The courts have consistently upheld the responsibility of both states and manufacturers to warn consumers of the hazards posed by pesticides. This duty is in no way inconsistent with federal pesticide laws, including those governing ""misbranding.""

While one action may lead to greater profits for a manufacturer, the same action may lead to harmful health outcomes for the consumer. I say as a general rule, the more transparency the better.

I strongly disagree with the current stance on weakening pesticide restrictions and urge the agency to take decisive action to ban glyphosate nationwide for the health and safety of all Americans. Glyphosate has been linked to severe health risks, including cancer, endocrine disruption, and harm to vital ecosystems. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen, and numerous studies have raised serious concerns about its long-term impact on human health and biodiversity.

While some may argue that glyphosate is essential for agricultural productivity, the trade-offs are far too great. Safer, sustainable alternatives exist, and many countries have already taken steps to limit or ban glyphosate due to the overwhelming scientific evidence of its dangers. The EPA must prioritize public health over corporate interests and implement a complete ban on glyphosate to protect our communities, food supply, and environment.

I urge the agency to follow the precautionary principle and act immediately to eliminate glyphosate from use in the United States. A failure to do so puts millions of Americans at risk.

By requiring all pesticide labeling to be consistent with the EPA’s findings of pesticides, the additional health warnings imposed by individual states would be overridden, reducing public protection.

All pesticides sold or distributed in the United States must be registered with the EPA. The Federal Pesticide Laws and Associated Statutes say the requirements for registration require proof that when used the pesticide, “will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.” This includes both unreasonable risks to human health and the environment, as well as human dietary risk from pesticide residues. Although the EPA sets national pesticide regulation, state pesticide offices work closely with the EPA and other federal agencies to enforce pesticide laws.

According to The National Pesticide Information Center, state governments play a large role in regulating pesticides past what the EPA’s federal pesticide regulations are. States must follow EPA regulations, so if their labeling does not identically match the EPA’s standards, it is because the states standards exceed the federal level warnings. This allows for more transparency about the health implications pesticides may have on the public. By enforcing a consistent label requirement across states, this proposed rule would likely reduce transparency and weaken public awareness of pesticide risks. I urge the EPA to reconsider this rule to prevent a nationwide rollback of critical health and safety protections.

It would clearly be overreach to restrict what State and Local authorities may do in regards to protecting their own children, maintenance workers, and other vulnerable citizens, as well as their local environment. Restricting state labeling requirements at a federal level would be a direct threat to our democracy and runs counter to the principles of the United States of America.

EPA-HQ-OPP-2024-0562-0423,"Posted by the Environmental Protection Agency on Feb 13, 2025","FIFRA makes clear that registration is not a defense to misbranding, see Section 136a(f)(2); yet, that is essentially what the Attorneys General seek to obtain with their proposed rule.

Were EPA to adopt such a regulation, it would make a pesticide misbranded and illegal to sell or distribute if the label had a warning about cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm, unless EPA also determined that the active ingredient carried these risks in its human health risk assessment. What this would mean is the registration of the active ingredient could immunize manufacturers from state law misbranding actions over a failure to warn about these health risks.

The proposed rule conflicts with FIFRA. Under no circumstances can the registration of one ingredient provide a blanket defense to a misbranding action pursuant to Section 136a(f)(2). Moreover, the proposed rule conflicts FIFRA's prohibition against pesticides with labeling that ""does not contain directions for use which are necessary for effecting the purpose for which the product is intended and if complied with, together with any requirements imposed under section 136a(d) of this title, are adequate to protect health and the environment."" 7 USC 136(q)(f). This is because the proposed rule focuses solely on the active ingredient without consideration of the adverse effects posed by inactive ingredients, impurities, or the entirety of the chemical composition. As EPA itself has recognized in the past, these other components can be toxicologically significant. As such, without consideration as to the pesticide's other ingredients or impurities or the pesticide as a whole, EPA does not have a rational basis for preemptively determining that warnings about cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm are unnecessary based solely on its human health risk assessment as to the active ingredient.

EPA does not have the authority to override Congress and the provisions set forth under FIFRA. As such, it does not have the power to enact the proposed rule."

While the petition targets California Prop 65 warnings on glyphosate products, it goes much further in restricting the authority of states to restrict pesticides under FIFRA. In 2019, EPA told California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) that its label language for glyphosate violated the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Subsequently, OEHHA explained to EPA:

Proposition 65 is a right-to-know law that requires businesses to provide a clear and reasonable warning prior to exposing people in California to chemicals that have been listed as carcinogens or reproductive toxins. The warnings provide an important public health benefit by allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their exposures to listed chemicals.

Proposition 65 mandates the listing of at least the chemicals that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies as carcinogens. In 2015, IARC classified glyphosate as a carcinogen, prompting California to include it in Proposition 65. Consequently, Proposition 65 requires businesses to provide warnings if their products containing glyphosate would result in exposures, unless those exposures are below a certain threshold.

California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) inquired with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about the legality of citing IARC’s classification in Proposition 65. In 2022, EPA affirmed that with such specificity, it would be permitted. While California offers various options for communicating Proposition 65 warnings, historically, the label has primarily conveyed warnings about pesticides.

In jury verdicts awarding damages to individuals suffering from cancer due to glyphosate exposure, courts have emphasized the failure to warn users of the hazards associated with the chemical. A Pesticides and You article (2005) by H. Bishop Dansby provides an explanation of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Bates v. Dow Agrosciences (U.S. Supreme Court, No. 03-388, 2005): “Manufacturers have a legal obligation to provide adequate warnings about the potential risks associated with their products, including pesticides. This duty arises from the recognition that manufacturers possess knowledge about the potential dangers of their products and have a responsibility to inform consumers about these risks.”

Regarding pesticide regulation, FIFRA explicitly states that a state may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device within its borders, provided that such regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this Act. Furthermore, FIFRA requires uniformity of labeling. The AG petition, however, focuses solely on the uniformity of labels and seeks to prohibit states from requiring product labels to warn users of potential hazards. This approach would subject users to increased risks of illness and neglect the fundamental principle of protecting people, land, and water from hazards.

States and local governments often employ creative measures to safeguard their residents, the environment, and public health from potential dangers. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right of states to protect their citizens from poisoning and contamination, recognizing the importance of safeguarding public well-being. The petition’s conclusion is clear: the AGs appear indifferent to the harm caused to farmers and other individuals in their states by pesticides, and they should not be able to seek compensation for adverse effects resulting from inadequate labeling.

The courts have consistently recognized the state’s and manufacturer’s “duty to warn” of pesticide hazards as a fundamental right and responsibility that does not conflict with federal pesticide law’s “misbranding” regulations. Therefore, we must uph

If this administration believes in returning power to the states, this should be no problem for the EPA. Let the people affected decide what chemicals are used where they live. For too long chemical companies and others have lobbied and bullied our lawmakers and citizens for the right to jeopardize our farmlands and our health and well being.

There is NO ""safe"" manufactured pesticide, only those which nature has created are safe, as well as effective, but don't line big Pharma's pockets, so are summarily rejected.

Humans were to be responsible for taking good care of the earth and it is a shame how that job was ignored by certain people who do not care about animal life or human life. The bible says Yahweh will destroy those who are destroying the earth. That was a warning from God. America is the biggest user of chemicals even in warfare as we know in the Vietnam War. Many children were born deformed from the use of Agent Orange and other chemicals in Vietnam. Ane the American soldiers had horrible skin diseases from being sprayed upon too. Americal should have learned a lesson back then. These people who are getting rich from these chemical companies are not going to get away from all the harm they did. There are people behind these companies who are making these decisions, and they will have to answer to the Almighty Creator at Judgement.

Ipdated labels could also include clearer instructions on safe disposal and environmental precautions, which would help reduce pollution and protect biodiversity.

However, I encourage the EPA to collaborate closely with scientific experts and environmental groups to strike a balance between regulatory clarity and industry feasibility. Implementing changes that are practical and scientifically backed will ensure compliance and maximize positive outcomes.

I believe this rulemaking is a step in the right direction toward improving pesticide safety and environmental sustainability."

EPA-HQ-OPP-2024-0562-0268,"Posted by the Environmental Protection Agency on Feb 12, 2025","Dear EPA Officials,
I am writing to express my deep concern regarding efforts to grant agrochemical companies immunity from liability for the harms caused by their products. Such policies would have devastating consequences for public health, environmental integrity, and the rights of farmers and consumers.
For decades, the agrochemical industry has assured the public that its pesticides, herbicides, and genetically modified seeds are safe. However, independent research continues to link these products to cancer, endocrine disruption, neurological disorders, and biodiversity loss. When corporations are shielded from accountability, those who suffer the most are farmers forced into dependency on toxic products, consumers exposed to harmful residues, and ecosystems devastated by chemical pollution.
History has repeatedly demonstrated the dangers of unchecked corporate influence in agriculture. DDT, Agent Orange, and glyphosate were once deemed safe—only for their toxic consequences to be revealed decades later. Granting these companies legal immunity would remove any incentive for them to ensure their products do not cause harm, allowing profits to take precedence over public safety.
I urge the EPA to uphold its duty to protect the environment and public health by opposing any policies that grant agrochemical corporations immunity from liability. Instead, regulatory measures should require independent, long-term safety testing and strict accountability for any harm caused by these products.
The EPA must prioritize the health of the people and the planet over corporate interests. I appreciate your attention to this critical issue and look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
Latisha Roe"

suis extrêmement préoccupé par les ramifications de cette pétition de réglementation si elle est adoptée. Cette pétition est une attaque directe soutenue par l’industrie des pesticides contre la capacité des gouvernements locaux à protéger leurs communautés et leurs résidents. S’il est adopté, ce changement priverait les États de leur droit de protéger leurs résidents contre les pesticides en fonction de leurs besoins et préoccupations spécifiques en limitant leur pouvoir de mettre en œuvre des avertissements sur les pesticides ou des lois sur la protection des consommateurs.

Les États ont longtemps détenu le pouvoir de restreindre l’utilisation de ces pesticides au-delà du gouvernement fédéral, et pour de bonnes raisons. Même les pesticides approuvés pour une utilisation à l’échelle nationale ne sont pas utilisés uniformément partout. Chaque région agricole a ses propres besoins, notamment des climats et des cultures uniques. Près de 200 communautés à l’échelle nationale ont mis en place des restrictions sur les pesticides pour résoudre des problèmes locaux tels que des conditions écologiques uniques nécessitant des mesures plus strictes que les normes fédérales, ou pour protéger les populations vulnérables à proximité des terrains de jeux et des espaces publics. Les gouvernements des États doivent continuer d’avoir le droit non seulement de réglementer l’utilisation des pesticides pour protéger leurs propres communautés, mais aussi d’avertir les utilisateurs de pesticides des dangers potentiels pour la santé.

De même, les États conservent le pouvoir de protéger leurs communautés contre les dommages causés par des produits, y compris les produits pesticides que l’EPA réglemente en vertu de la FIFRA. S’il est adopté, ce changement limiterait également la capacité des Américains touchés par les pesticides à exercer un recours juridique en dommages-intérêts. L’EPA a la responsabilité de protéger les Américains contre les pesticides nocifs, et non de protéger l’industrie des pesticides contre les poursuites intentées par des Américains lésés par leurs produits.

SUBJECT:Comments: Docket EPA-HQ-OPP-2024-0562.
Contact:VT.PAPAN@gmail.com

This docket proposes to amend the existing regulations under the Federal Insecticide, Rodenticide, and Fungicide Act (FIFRA). “EPA requests public comment on a petition received from several state Attorneys General that asks EPA to amend 40 CFR 156.10(a)(5) by adding a paragraph (xi) to include the following as an example of statements or representations in the labeling which constitute misbranding: “Statements or conclusions regarding the product's human health effects, including the likelihood of causing cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm, that are different from EPA's findings and conclusions stated in its human health risk assessment conducted during the registration review of the product's principal active ingredients.”

1. Why we are interested. In 2022 several of our group attended rulemaking meetings of the Vermont Legislative Council on Administrative Rules (LCAR). We were concerned that the 30-year old pesticide regulations under revision would not include language about PFAS in pesticides or in adjuvants. Indeed, there was no consideration of this issue in the process.
It is even more important now to be able to label pesticides with their dangers, especially as more pesticides are fluorinated, thereby more toxic, more persistent and more bio-accumulative with increased but unassessed impacts on human and ecological health. Pesticides are causing illness in more people than ever, disrupting endocrine systems, increasing cancers in children and youth, and undermining our immune systems.

2. How the policy would impact our situation.
Vermont is impacted by high pesticide use in agriculture, on railroad and utility right-of-ways and substations, on golf courses and in landscaping. Farmworkers and residents are exposed through these uses. Pesticides are contaminating water sources and food. Citizens need to know what chemicals we are being exposed to and the dangers they bring.

3. Missing perspective: This policy would seriously impede the difficult process of bringing regulations on fluorinated pesticides in line with the evolving science of PFAS in pesticides. Fluorination of pesticides presents adverse effects to life not yet acknowledged by EPA. The dangers of PFAS active ingredients in pesticides may be dismissed by the adoption of this rule, a danger and risk that EPA must not accept.

4. Another missing perspective: This docket does not help us to protect pollinators needed to grow food, or to maintain ecological health for future generations.

5. RECOMMENDATION: “The mission of EPA is to protect human health and the environment.” https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20EPA%20is,enforce%20through%20their%20own%20regulations. The proposed amendment will not contribute positively to this mission in any way. We recommend that EPA oppose the petition by the several States Attorneys General to amend 40 CFR 156.10(a)(5) to restrict the language on pesticide labels.

EPA-HQ-OPP-2024-0562-2362,"Posted by the Environmental Protection Agency on Apr 2, 2025","I strongly oppose the petition and any other efforts to limit existing state and local authority to regulate pesticides. The Environmental Protection Agency should not amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) rulemaking to protect pesticide companies from legal liability. Instead, the Environmental Protection Agency should protect human health as your mission directs. The Environmental Protection Agency is tasked with protecting human health and the environment, not to protect the economic interests of pesticide companies.

The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act sets the floor on pesticide safety. Weakening state’s regulatory authority is contrary to FIFRA’s intentional and longstanding balance of authorities. Under FIFRA, states and localities have the authority to impose restrictions on sale and use of pesticides that are more stringent than federal requirements. They also have authority to require warnings and other information designed to allow consumers to make informed decisions about pesticide use and exposure.

Preemption takes decision making power out of the hands of those most impacted by pesticide use. States and localities are often in a much better position than the Environmental Protection Agency to quickly assess risks, consider emerging evidence, and to make decisions to protect their unique local environments and communities, including schools and childcare facilities, from toxic pesticides. Undermining that authority would hamstring critical local efforts to address cancer and other human health risks, threats to water resources, and harms to pollinators and other wildlife.

I support organic farms and want organic farmers to be informed by state and local authorities when herbicides are being used in adjoining public spaces (such as roadsides and waterways). Organic businesses will suffer immense harm if the right to warn is impeded.

The petition is an affront to the rights of all Americans. Federal pesticide regulations should establish a minimum labeling standard. Such regulations should not preempt the rights of states to enact science-based regulations they deem necessary to protect their own residents.
The Attorneys General of Nebraska, Iowa, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, South Carolina, and South Dakota have been pressured by Bayer and other pesticide companies because they don’t want to have to face existing and future litigation from people harmed by their dangerous products. Their motivation is clear—they simply wish to remove the expense that comes with potential liability. This collusion is not acceptable.

Meanwhile, states and localities around the country have worked under the correct assumption that federal regulations set minimum requirements for pesticide regulation. Many state and local governments have opted to enact stronger pesticide regulations and ordinances than the Environmental Protection Agency’s registration process, which is in line with existing FIFRA rules. These local entities are more aware of the needs of their people and the special circumstances in their area that require additional rules.

The rulemaking changes outlined in the request seek to make federal requirements both the floor and the ceiling for pesticide regulations. This goes beyond the mandate given by federal law and would negate hundreds of local regulations that were developed and agreed upon by the people in many locations of the United States.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s review processes are slow to respond to new information. While we recognize the deliberate pace is due to a combination of procedure and limited capacity, the Environmental Protection Agency should also recognize that more nimble bodies of government must be afforded the ability to respond quickly to risks brought to their communities by pesticides. Some of these products have been linked to serious health harms including cancer, neurotoxicity, and child development issues and reproductive difficulties. Often, these links are uncovered or strengthened after the Environmental Protection Agency has approved a pesticide for use under FIFRA. State and local governments should retain the ability to act to further protect their people from potential pesticide harms.

It is not the Environmental Protection Agency’s job to protect pesticide corporations. Instead, it is the Environmental Protection Agency’s job to protect me and my family from the harmful effects of pesticides. I respectfully request that you put my health and safety ahead of the profits brought in by pesticide companies like Bayer/Monsanto, Syngenta/ChemChina, and others. The Environmental Protection Agency must reject this petition for unacceptable changes to existing pesticide labeling regulations to protect states’ rights and the rights of all Americans."

This rulemaking petition would bring sickness and even fatalities.
Residents, workers and supply chain employees are at risk when data and health statistics are not a priority. Local governments must be allowed to to protect their communities and residents. Here in Horry County, residential growth is exponential. This puts families next to farms as soybean and cotton fields are sold off for housing developments. The risk for harm is huge without pesticide use regulations that mean something.

States have long held the power to restrict the use of these pesticides above and beyond the federal government.

States similarly retain the power to protect their communities from harms caused by products, including the pesticide products that EPA regulates under FIFRA.

“Manufacturers have a legal duty to provide adequate warnings about the potential risks associated with their products, including pesticides. This duty arises from the recognition that manufacturers possess knowledge about the potential dangers of their products and have a responsibility to inform consumers about these risks.”

With regard to pesticide regulation, FIFRA clearly states, “A State may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device in the State, but only if and to the extent the regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this Act,” which is followed by a clause requiring uniformity of labeling. By focusing on the uniformity of labels, the AG petition would prohibit the state from requiring product labels to warn users of potential hazards, thus subjecting users to greater risk of illness.

States and local governments often take creative measures to protect people, land, and water from hazards. States and local governments believe in their right to protect their residents from poisoning and contamination, a right that has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. The only conclusion that can be derived from the petition is that the AGs do not care if the people, including farmers, of their states are harmed by pesticides, and they should not be able to seek compensation if they suffer adverse effects due to a failure to warn on a pesticide label. The courts have upheld a state’s and manufacturer’s “duty to warn” of pesticide hazards as a right and responsibility that is not at odds with “misbranding” regulations under federal pesticide law.

In the past, I worked as a field research rep for 13 years for one of the major pesticide companies, so I understand what their focus is about. However, I now have an organic garden. I better understand how to manage land and crops in a healthy manner, such that fewer ""chemicals"" are needed.
